# This is a helper function used by the @route decorator to take a Flask-like
# route pattern and make a compiled regular expression that tests for whether
# an incoming HTTP request path matches the @route's path pattern. It uses
# named groups to pick out parts of the path that become keyword arguments
# to the route function.
def parse_route_path_string(path):
  # path looks something like:
  #   /<organization>/<project>/documents
  # Brackets denote variables holding filename-like characters only.
  # Everything else is a literal character.
  #
  # Convert the route path into a regular expression with named groups, e.g. into:
  # /(?P<organization>\w+)/(?P<project>\w+)/(?P<documents>\w+)$

  # This is a helper function that takes each <varable> or unmached
  # literal character and returns a regular expression for that
  # variable or character.

  def replacer(m):

      # Return an equivalent named group like (?P<variable>[ALLOWED_PATH_CHARS]+).
      # ALLOWED_PATH_CHARS contains characters that path variables are allowed to
      # match against. It's important that this list does not contain a slash because
      # we usually separate variables in URL patterns with slashses. Everything
      # else is just to restrict URLs to sane and safe values.
